This is the data set for the Ames, Iowa Housing Kaggle competition. This is the original version of the data set, which includes all rows and target information.

This means that if you would like to have a large "unknown" to test on, you should do an initial train/test split (50/50 is the original kaggle split) before working on the data further. 

Once you have decided if you would like to have a large unknown set to test on, you can continue with the data cleaning and EDA as normal. Please take some time to refer to the data manual provided. Good luck!
